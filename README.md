# Mini-Golf-Simulator

This was a team project that I led during my third year of computing at Queen's University. I led discussions regarding development and aided all separate members in accomplishing various administrative and technical tasks. We worked on collision physics, art assets and level design while using Jira, Confluence and Bitbucket to track progress and update workflow. We published the game on the itch.io page of one of the lead programmers, as a means of easy access for the future. Just download the game after following the link and click into the .exe file to play! Below is the link:
